## Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to the unofficial reolink camera api :smile:

We hope that this documentation site will help you in your endeavour of building nice
tools on top of our libraries. We are hoping to build a set of tools and software that
would help you out in your hobby/work/curiosity.

The work presented here has all been open sourced and will stay open source. It all started with
a little side project [reolink-python-api](https://github.com/ReolinkClientAPI/reolink-python-api)
in the hopes that it would reach and help others' out there. This certainly came true and now I
intend to expand the project into multiple components, spanning (currently) two different
languages, namely golang and python. 

With the support of Reolink (yes the company) and Oleaintueri (my organiation) I will hopefully
give some open source solutions to the problems faced in the community currently.
