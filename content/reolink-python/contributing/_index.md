We invite contributions to the project and would love to hear your ideas. If you uncertain about
if a certain feature would be appreciated, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolink-python-api/issues/new).
This way we can be notified of any changes you would like to make.

The library uses a simple technique to get the API calls made by the Reolink cameras' Web UI to the
cameras built-in web server. We just extract these calls by looking through the browsers' console.

To get started with the revers engineering process, follow the steps below.

#### Step 1

Get the Restful API calls by looking through the HTTP Requests made in the cameras' web UI. 

##### In Chrome and Firefox
Google Chrome developer mode (ctr + shift + i) -> Network.

#### Step 2

Fork the repository and make your changes.

#### Step 3

Make a pull request.
