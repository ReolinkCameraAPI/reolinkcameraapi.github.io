# Python Api Client

{{< reolinkpythontags >}}

---

A Reolink Camera client written in Python. This repository's purpose **(with Reolink's full support)** is to deliver a complete API for the Reolink Cameras,
although they have a basic API document - it does not satisfy the need for extensive camera communication.

Other supported languages: [reolinkapigo](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapigo)
