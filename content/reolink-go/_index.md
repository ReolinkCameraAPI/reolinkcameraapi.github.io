# Go Api Client

A Reolink Camera client written in Go. This repository's
purpose **(with Reolink's full support)** is to deliver a
complete API for the Reolink Cameras,
although they have a basic API document - it does not satisfy the
need for extensive camera communication.

Check out our documentation for more information on how to use the software at [https://reolink.oleaintueri.com](https://oleaintueri.com)

Other Supported Languages: [reolink-python-api](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraApi/reolink-python-api)

The reolink-go-api project is the go alternative to the reolink-python-api project. It provides the same functionality,
but just in pure Go.
